### EndGame Logical Agent Map and Situation Sequence Generator
A Generator for the EndGame agent, generates the grid and the situation sequence.
### Implementation
The Generator generates a grid orientation in size mxn where both are input for the genGrid method.<br>
The printGrid function prints the grid generated for the programmer to see and inspect.<br>
The solver function solves the grid that was generated as a search problem where it is traversed in BFS.
### Testing
    1) Copy the grid orientation generated and the situation sequence.
    2) Generate your KB for the agent from your fact generator implemented.
    3) Input Snapped(\<Situation Squence\>) that was generated, your program should return true.
<br>
Good Luck!
